# Description:
Here is a collection of examples written to demonstrate various concepts in statistical physics. These are designed to give the user an intuitive understanding of concepts including entropy and temperature. To use, either select a link below, or download a project and run a server (either by opening the index.html file or by running a host like live-server).

## Dependencies
Some of these examples rely on [Matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js/) to calculate collisions of bodies; the needed files are included in the root directory of this repo.
